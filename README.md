# Introduction

The tech stack for this test was:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- [Theme Ui](https://theme-ui.com/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Frontend

**Theme UI** is dealing with themeable user interfaces. There is only one theme, however it can be easily changed by enhancing the `common/theme/src` package

I am using the ThemeUi [Variants Approach](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) to style some reusable components
